    <h2>Impacts of Drought<img src="C4BA63B6-8A41-4003-B92B-B587615F7F8F.png" class="img"></h2>
    <header><p> &nbsp;Drought affects agriculture, water supply, and the environment, leading to food shortages and economic strain.
Droughts can have many impacts on communities, including:
Environmental
Droughts can damage ecosystems, reduce plant growth, and harm wildlife and fish. They can also increase the risk of wildfires and insect outbreaks, and alter the cycling of water, nutrients, and carbon. 
Health
Droughts can increase the risk of disease and death by limiting access to food and water. They can also cause malnutrition, respiratory illnesses, and mental health issues. 
Displacement
Droughts can force people to leave their homes to find clean water and food. This is especially true for women and children, who may have to sacrifice school or other work to carry water. 
Economic
Droughts can lead to job losses in rural areas, where many people rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. This can lead to people migrating to other areas in search of work, a phenomenon known as "distress migration". 
Water supply
Droughts can lead to lower water levels in lakes and reservoirs, and reduced stream and river flows. 
Air quality
Droughts can make wildfires and dust storms more likely, which can harm air quality. </p>

    <p><h3>How Does Drought Affect Our Lives?</h3>
        When we have a drought, it can affect our communities and our environment in many different ways. Everything in the environment is connected, just like everything in our communities is connected. Each different way that drought affects us is what we call an impact of drought.
        
        Drought affects our lives in many different ways because water is such an important part of so many of our activities. We need water to live, and animals and plants do too. We need water to grow the food we eat. We also use water for many different things in our lives, like washing dishes, cooking, bathing, and swimming or river rafting. Water is also used to help make the electricity we use to run the lights in our houses and the video games you may like to play. When we donâ€™t have enough water for these activities because of a drought, many people and many different things will be affected in many different ways.
