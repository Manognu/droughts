                Droughts can occur in any region of the world, but some areas are more prone to them than others: 
                Africa: The Horn of Africa has experienced little to no rain for the last several rainy seasons. Somalia was the country most at risk of drought in 2020, and other countries in Africa at high risk include Zimbabwe and Djibouti. 
                India: The states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana, northern Karnataka, and southeastern Maharashtra are particularly prone to drought. 
                South America: Central and southern South America have been experiencing drought since 2008. 
                North America: California and the Prairie Provinces and Northern Ontario in Canada have been experiencing drought since 2011. 
                Asia: Central Asia has been experiencing drought. 
                Europe: Central and southern Europe have been experiencing drought. 
                Droughts are caused by prolonged periods of drier-than-average weather, which leads to water shortages. Global warming is increasing the frequency and severity of droughts. Higher temperatures cause more evaporation, which dries out the soil and increases plant stress. </p>
